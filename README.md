# YesNoAnagrams

**You should:**

+ Define two strings to be compared as input.

+ Remove any non-alphabetic characters from both strings and convert them to lowercase.

+ Sort both strings alphabetically.

+ Compare the sorted strings to see if they are equal.

+ If the sorted strings are equal, the original strings are anagrams. If not, they are not anagrams.

+ Display the result on the console.


**Here is an example of how the program should work:**

```
Input: "rail safety", "fairy tales"
Output: "These two strings are anagrams."
```
```
Input: "Hello World", "Goodbye World"
Output: "These two strings are not anagrams."
```
